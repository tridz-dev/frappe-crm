> ⚠️ You are customizing the **CRM view** within a Frappe-based application. Adhere strictly to the following project-specific guidelines.

---

### 🧩 Project Context

- The CRM module resides within the **`crm` app** of a Frappe project.(/home/jezlan/v14/jezlan-15/apps/crm/crm)
- The **frontend components** to be customized are located in the **`frontend` folder** inside the `crm` app. (/home/jezlan/v14/jezlan-15/apps/crm/frontend)

---

### 🛠️ Development Guidelines

1. **Utilize Frappe UI Standards**
   - Employ standard Frappe components, layouts, and methods for both backend and frontend development.
   - Refer to the official Frappe UI documentation for guidance: [Frappe UI Documentation](https://ui.frappe.io/) .

2. **Maintain Existing Design Consistency**
   - Ensure that any UI modifications align with the current **font, layout, and visual style** used in the CRM module.
   - Avoid introducing new styles unless explicitly required.

3. **Follow Existing Code Structure and Style**
   - Review and adhere to the **current coding conventions** present in the `crm` app for both JavaScript/TypeScript and Python.
   - Preserve the existing folder structure and naming conventions.

4. **Reference Existing CRM Code**
   - Reuse existing code patterns from the `crm` app wherever feasible to maintain consistency and reduce redundancy.

### 📝 Documentation Requirements

- For **any major changes**, including:
  - UI modifications
  - Functional logic alterations
  - API additions or refactoring
  - Data model adjustments

  ➤ **Create a `.md` documentation file** detailing:
   - The nature of the change
   - The rationale behind the change
   - Usage instructions for any new features (if applicable)

- Save all `.md` files to the designated **documentation folder (/home/jezlan/v14/jezlan-15/apps/crm/frontend/docs)** as specified by the project.

- For each major change, create or update a `README.md` file in the relevant folder (e.g., UI, functions, models) summarizing:
  - The purpose of the module or feature
  - Important notes or dependencies
  - Any known limitations

---

### ✅ Final Notes

- **Ensure existing functionality remains unaffected**.
